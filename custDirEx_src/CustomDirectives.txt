			**** Custom Directives ****

	- Creating our own directive based on application requirement
	  Called as Custom Directive.

	- In Angular, we can Use Custom Directives in 2 ways.

		2) Structural Type


			*** Attribute Type ***


	- Directive is the predefined class used to create the Custom Directive

	- ElementRef is the Predefined Class used to manipulate the DOM Elements.

	- HostListener is the Predefined Class used to apply the mouse events.

	- Input is the Predefined Class used to pass the Dynamic Data to Custom Directive.

	- Attribute Type Custom Directive won't work with the DOM Directly(memory).
